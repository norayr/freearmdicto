in order to use produced dictionary with stardict issue

>cp -a armdicto ~/.stardict/dic/

if there's no such directory, then create it.

in order to use these files with other dictionary software you need to copy them to corresponding directories. for example, for Sidudict under SailfishOS it's

>~/.local/share/harbour-sidudict/

mstardict for maemo fremantle searches dictionaries in

>~/.MyDocs/mstardict

there is also software for android which you can use these dictionary files with.
